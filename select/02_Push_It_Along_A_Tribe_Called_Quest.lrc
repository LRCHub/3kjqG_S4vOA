[00:44.58] (Q-Tip)
[01:17.88] Q-Tip is my title.
[01:18.82] I don't think that is vital for me to be your idol,
[01:20.83] But dig this recital.
[01:21.88] If you can't envision a brother who ain't dissin
[01:24.86] Slingin' this and that, 'cause this and that was missin
[01:27.84] Instead, it's been injected, the Tribe has been perfected
[01:29.96] Oh yes, it's been selected, the art makes it protected
[01:31.91] Afrocentric livin', Africans be givin
[01:34.96] A lot to the cause 'cause the cause has been risen
[01:38.08] Some brothers, they be flammin', thinkin' we ain't slammin
[01:40.06] Comin' off like the days where we used to wear the tans and
[01:43.05] A blue-colllar talker, a hemisphere stalker
[01:45.03] A glass of O.J and a ten mile walk-a
[01:48.14] If you're in a Jeep and you dig what you're hearin
[01:50.10] Can I get a beep and a side order of cheerin?
[01:53.18] I am what I am, that's a tribal man
[01:56.14] We all know the colours, we all must stand
[01:58.29] As we start our travels, things they will unravel
[02:00.23] "Que sera sera", for this unit is like gravel
[02:02.28] Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
[02:05.21] If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
[02:25.21] 
[02:08.26] Chorus:
[02:09.35] Push it along, push it along.
[02:11.36] Push it along, yeah, push it along. (repeat 4x)
[02:34.86] 
[02:23.33] (Phife Dawg)
[02:28.45] Put one up for the Phifer, it's time to decipher
[02:30.43] The ills of the world make the situation lighter
[02:33.52] The clock is always tickin', the systems should be kickin
[02:35.54] Like? ham and eggs, I eat chicken, chicken, chicken
[02:38.50] Should I release the lever, the lever of the clever
[02:41.50] Embelish on the funk as we start to endeavour?
[02:43.42] The? wraughts? of the rap filling up the gap
[02:46.32] With the smash of a hand and a little toe tap
[03:08.82] 
[02:48.43] (Q-Tip)
[02:49.49] The boom, the bip, the boom bip
[02:51.58] Indicates to the brothers that we be on the flip tip
[02:53.57] Phonies start to crumble, funky rhythm rumbles
[02:55.55] Through the dance-hall, but my anthem is humble
[02:59.50] It's the nitty-gritty, my time is itty-bitty
[03:01.63] So I? kick the slash for the gipper? and the witty
[03:03.64] This ain't trial and error, more like tribe and error
[03:05.66] Constantly rude as some sort of tribal terror
[03:08.69] The street can't depart from the bloody heart
[03:11.78] Repair the wear and tear, don't start 'fore it starts
[03:13.70] Won't be gone for long, listen to the song
[03:16.79] If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
[03:36.79] 
[03:19.76] Repeat chorus
[03:26.26] 
[03:38.84] (Q-Tip)
[03:39.89] Marchin' off the project, we hope that you will subject
[04:02.09] It's good to be an object and never, ever reject
[04:05.13] The tribe who meanders with drunken propoganda
[04:07.10] Keep it in boom and never will we slander
[04:10.16] ? Should be handed, don't let me demand it
[04:12.19] Money gives a nudge to the poet star bandit
[04:15.17] Control it, then recluse it, follow, you won't lose it
[04:17.29] Mysterious is the tribe for we choose it
[04:20.24] Although she's flippin' crazy, give my love to Gracy
[04:22.20] God, could you help 'cause this Quest is crazy spacey?
[04:25.21] The pigs are wearin' blue, and in a year or two
[04:27.39] We'll be goin' up the creek in a great big canoe
[04:30.32] What we gonna do, save me and my brothers?
[04:33.22] Hop inside the bed and pull over the covers
[04:35.30] Never will we do that and we ain't tryin' to rule that
[04:37.43] We just want a slab of the ham, don't you know, black?
[04:40.45] This society of fake reality
[04:42.41] Are nothin' but a peg of informality
[04:45.42] While I sing my song, sing it all day long,
[04:47.52] If you can't pull it, all ya gotta do is
[05:07.52] 
[04:50.55] Repeat chorus
