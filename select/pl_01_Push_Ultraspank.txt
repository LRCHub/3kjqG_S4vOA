I've felt the tap
On my shoulder
I've turned around
And grown older
I feel it burning
On the horizon
The orange glow
I've never known
Push
I've been left here out in the
cold
It's nothing different a story
of old
A thin line push in close
A thin line no one knows
Push
See it down
Push
See it drown
How'd I get here
What have I sold
I can feel it within
I can feel it begin
It's hard down here
With just an idea
That's never clear
Push
I need something to bring it
down
I need something to hold it down
It's hard
Down here
With just an idea
That's never clear
Never told me
What you wanted
Only sold me
What you needed to
I need something to bring it
down
I need something to call my own
The thin line
Push in close
A thin line
No one knows
I need something to bring it
down
I need something to hold it down
